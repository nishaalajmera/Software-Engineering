Packages are slowly moving to use `pipenv` ([link](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)) to create all dependencies in a clean and concise manner. More examples in this [link](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#packaging-python-projects)\n",

Usually repos don't have enough information, check this [page](https://www.makeareadme.com) to see how to create a good README file.<br>_Small tip: get familiar with markdown or reStructuredText files. They allow you to create professional README files!_\n",
    "- `LICENSE`: This text describes the license that you are using for the project. If you are distributing a project, it is a good idea to add one. `GitHub` has shortcuts to add them to your repo, but if you are unsure of which one you should use, check this [page](https://ufal.github.io/public-license-selector/) or this [one](https://choosealicense.com)\n",
    "- `.gitgnore`: If you don't want to keep track of certain files, for example those that are note relevant for other users such as `__pycache__` or `.DS_Store`, or your personal virtual environment if you created it in your repo, you can add these in `.gitignore` as plain text."
