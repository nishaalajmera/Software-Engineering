    "Here is the solution: instead of creating a rigid inheritance structure, we can leverage Python's duck typing and multiple inheritance. As we saw, Python allows multiple inheritance, and it is possible to create a class that inherits from multiple classes.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Following this principle, composition is a more flexible alternative to inheritance. It is possible to create a class that contains characteristics from many parent classes, so we can use that feature to ONLY inherit what we want.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "_Consider composition as pieces of a Lego set. We can combine these pieces to create a complex object. But those pieces can also be used to create a different object._\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "> ## Composition is the converse of decomposition: pieces with different functionalities are combined to create a whole.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Many languages implement composition through interfaces, which are formal definitions of methods and data that a particular class MUST implement. Python does not have interfaces, but by using multiple inheritance, we can build a similar mechanism, which in Python is referred to as a mixin.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    " A mixin is a class that provides methods to other classes but are not considered a base class. For example, a dog can speak and roll_over, and eventually you will want to create a class that can speak and roll_over, so you can create classes to be inherited to add the speak and rolling over abilities for other objects."
