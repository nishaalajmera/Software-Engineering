      "    `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in\n",

      "  - Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine\n",

      "  - Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python\n",

      "  - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets.\n",

      "    Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5\n",
