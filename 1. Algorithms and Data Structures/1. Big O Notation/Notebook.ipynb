You have to bear in mind that these techniques don't come easily to you, but by practicing, you will develop a sense of detecting when your code can be improved. Additionally, we used two new classes we haven't seen before, and it's natural you didn't know them, no one expects you to know all Python libraries, the imporant thing is that you are not likely the first one to find a particular error, and the solution is out there, waiting for you to find it!"
